A visualization tool for single cell RNA sequencing data.

In your R or Rstudio console, run the following code:

library(shiny)
runGitHub("Single-Cell-RNAseq-Visualization", "prestonaschultz", launch.browser = TRUE, ref="main")

This should launch the site as a web browser. From here, you can see all of the package installations, changes, and working parts of the site in your R console. Please give time when using the "Heatmaps" or "Results/Data Table" features. When you use these two features, you will see the clusters downloading. Please wait for these to download before clicking on anything.
